Yes, these two are using two-way ESP-NOW connections to send simple messages. This was a challenging project, not because of the two-way ESP-NOW itselfâ€”I learned how to make two-way ESP-NOW communication by reading a great tutorial on the Random Nerd Tutorials site. The challenge was making this using the small M5Stack Atom S3 board, an ESP32-S3 device with a built-in 128x128 display, IR LED, push button, accelerometer, gyroscope, and more. Of course, one push button was not enough for this project, so I designed a simple PCB. The sponsor of this video is PCBWay. On their site, you can find and order these PCBs and read more information about this project. Along with PCBs, they offer many different services such as 3D printing, CNC machining, and more. The link is in the description; feel free to check it out. The PCB is simple but works great; the quality of their PCBs is always top-notch.
